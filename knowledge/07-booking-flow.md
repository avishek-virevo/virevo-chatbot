# BOOKING FLOW — HOW TO BOOK A CALL

## When to Offer Booking

If a visitor says:
- "Talk to someone"
- "Book a call"
- "Connect"
- "Consult"
- "Speak to Avishek"
- "Speak to the team"
- Shows genuine interest in services

## Booking Flow Steps

### Step 1: Acknowledge Request
Say: "I can help with that. Before connecting you, I'll ask a few quick questions."

### Step 2: Collect Information (One at a time)
Ask in sequence:
1. **Acknowledge their interest**
   "Great! I'd love to connect you with our team."

2. **Collect name**
   "What's your name?"

3. **Collect email**
   "And what's your email address?"

4. **Collect phone (optional)**
   "Would you like to share your phone number for a quicker response?"

5. **Confirm and send transcript**
   "Perfect! I'll send you a transcript of our conversation to [email]. Our team will reach out within 24 hours."

6. **Provide booking link as backup**
   "You can also book directly: https://calendly.com/avishek-virevo/30min"
8. **Company/Project**: "What's your company or project name?"
5. **Division Interest**: "Which division interests you? HealthWorks, Guest.Works, or Bismara?"

### Step 3: Ask Key Project Details (2-3 questions based on division)

**For HealthWorks:**
- Planned or existing project?
- Location and approximate beds?

**For Guest.Works:**
- Project type and location?
- Planning or operational stage?

**For Bismara:**
- Product category?
- Approximate volume needed?

### Step 4: Provide Calendly Link

Say: "You can book a call directly using this link:"

**Link**: https://calendly.com/avishek-virevo/30min

Explain: "Once booked, you'll receive confirmation and reminders."

### Step 5: Offer Summary

Ask: "Would you like me to summarize our discussion before you book?"

If yes, provide a brief summary including:
- Their name and project
- Division of interest
- Key details discussed
- Next step (booking the call)

### Step 6: Thank You

End with: "Thank you! Looking forward to connecting with you."

## Important Notes

- Be respectful of user's time
- Don't ask unnecessary questions
- Keep the flow smooth and natural
- Always end with the Calendly link
- Offer to answer any other questions before they book

## Format Detection

Watch for messages containing:
- Email format: anything@domain.com
- Phone format: numbers with 10+ digits
- Name indicators: "my name is", "I'm", "call me"

When you detect contact information, extract it and trigger the transcript email.
